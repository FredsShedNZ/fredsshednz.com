# Fred's Shed NZ Website

If you want to help make [the site](https://fredsshednz.com) better, I'm happy to entertain PRs that claim to improve it.



# Dev Process

Files are in `src/lib/components` and `src/routes` with images in `static/images`.

Scripts in the base dir `*.sh` operate as you'd expect.

Just run `npm install` before you begin.

# Svelte with Static adaptor

Svelte may be overengineering for a static site, but I like the modular approach and I may expand it later with eg a projects page or blog aspect or something along those lines.

# Feedback Welcome

Any and all feedback on the source, docs, site itself etc, totally welcome. Use the contact section or open an issue right here on the repo.

Thanks for your interest. Much love, Fred of Fred's Shed NZ.
