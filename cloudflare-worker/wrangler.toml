# TODO may be useful, need to handle caching correctly to keep costs reasonable:

# Note that, if "x-amz-content-sha256" is not included in ALLOWED_HEADERS, then
# any value supplied in the incoming request is discarded and
# "x-amz-content-sha256" will be set to "UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD".
#
# If you set ALLOWED_HEADERS, it is your responsibility to ensure that the
# list of headers that you specify supports the functionality that your client
# apps use, for example, "range". The list below is a suggested starting point.
#
# Note that HTTP headers are not case-sensitive. "host" will match "host",
# "Host" and "HOST".
#ALLOWED_HEADERS = [
#    "content-type",
#    "date",
#    "host",
#    "if-match",
#    "if-modified-since",
#    "if-none-match",
